👋🏾 <br>
Thank you for visiting my site. I love to experiment whether that's personally or professionally. I am highly organized, and I live to strike things off my Google Keep to do list. I believe in continually learning new skills, living a well-rounded life, and keeping an internal locus of control. I am happiest when I can make a delicious (and a bit experimental) meal for friends and family.


🏭<br>
I spent six years as a Process Engineer at Chevron at their Richmond Refinery where I supported various process units like a wastewater bioreactor, cogen gas turbines, diesel and gasoline <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodesulfurization" target="_blank">hydrotreaters</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_catalytic_cracking" target="_blank">fluidized catalytic cracter</a>. The operations and hands-on manufacturing experience I gained during this time are invaluable. Spending time working with physical equipment, real-time production, and a diverse workforce is something I will appreicate for the rest of my career.

I now work at ENGIE Impact as a Sustainability Consultant, specializing in Net Zero Manufacturing. I help clients worldwide reach their carbon goals through energy efficiency and smart capital investments. 

What interests me most is how digital technologies can help us optimally transition to a decarbonized future. My experience is a unique blend of manufacturing, process engineering, computer science, and sustainability.
