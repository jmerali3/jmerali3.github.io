👋🏾 <br>
Thank you for visiting my site. I love to experiment whether that's personally or professionally. I am highly organized, and I live to strike things off my Google Keep to do list. I believe in continually learning new skills, living a well-rounded life, and keeping an internal locus of control. I am happiest when I can make a delicious (and a bit experimental) meal for friends and family.


🏭<br>
I spent six years as a Process Engineer at Chevron at their Richmond Refinery where I supported various process units like a wastewater bioreactor, cogen gas turbines, diesel and gasoline [hydrotreaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodesulfurization), and most recently, the [fluidized catalytic cracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_catalytic_cracking), where we produced up to 80,000 barrels (or 3.3 million gallons) per day of fuel for the Bay Area. That's a lot of ⛽! I excel at driving process improvements and communicating effectively with people from different backgrounds. <br>
