I will continue to update this as she grows, and I will occasionally explore how this wonderful dog has changed our lives.

We brought her home on December 31st, 2020, a fitting end to a truly memorable year. We thought we were prepared. We read [The Art of Raising a Puppy](https://newsketemonks.com/products/the-art-of-raising-a-puppy) by the Monks of New Skete, which gave us an appreciation for the bond you can develop with an animal. It's true: the love you put into a dog, you receive tenfold in return.

Between worrying about Lottie getting [parvo](https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_dg_canine_parvovirus_infection) yet still requiring adequate socialization and us trying to stay safe from COVID, we had a frenetic start to the year. However, after the third vaccine, the house training, and our own adjustment to this new bit of chaos, things finally got easier. Each week that goes by, she continues to grow both mentally and physically, and she becomes more ingrained in our routines: the morning walks around Forest Hill, the Sunday trips to Crissy field then Devil's Teeth Bakery, the bimonthly winery or Tahoe trips.

This website is intended to be for professional explorations and ruminations. But Lottie is a part of my daily life and deserves a post (plus she's adorable). I only have to look between my monitors to see her lounging on the white leather couch, echoing the past generations of dogs who have sat there calmly staring out these same circletop windows.

Lottie Fact 1 - She was named after the 2020 Great British Bakeoff Contestant [Lottie Bedlow](https://www.instagram.com/lottiegotcake/?hl=en)

Lottie Fact 2 - Despite being bred for hunting water fowl and having a water-resistant double coat, she hates the water. We threw her in the pool anyway.

Lottie Fact 3 - She is *extremely* good at tug-of-war. It's scary.
