I will continue to update this as she grows, and I will occasionally explore how this wonderful dog has changed our lives.

We brought Lottie home on December 31st, 2020, a fitting end to a truly memorable year. We thought we were prepared. We read [The Art of Raising a Puppy](https://newsketemonks.com/products/the-art-of-raising-a-puppy) by the Monks of New Skete, which gave us an appreciation for the bond you can develop with an animal. It's true that the love you put into a dog, you receive tenfold in return.

Between worrying about Lottie getting [parvo](https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_dg_canine_parvovirus_infection) yet still requiring adequate socialization and us trying to stay safe from COVID, we had a frenetic start to the year. After the third vaccine, the house training, and our own adjustment to this new bit of chaos, things finally got easier. Each week that goes by she becomes more ingrained in our routines: the morning walks around Forest Hill, the Sunday trips to Crissy field and Devil's Teeth Bakery, the bimonthly winery or Tahoe trips.

This website is intended to be for professional explorations and ruminations. But Lottie is a part of my daily life and deserves a post (plus she's adorable). I only have to look between my monitors to see her lounging on the white leather couch, echoing the past generations of dogs who spent their days calmly staring out these same circletop windows.

Lottie Fact 1 - She was named after the 2020 Great British Bakeoff Contestant [Lottie Bedlow](https://www.instagram.com/lottiegotcake/?hl=en)

Lottie Fact 2 - She hates getting wet, despite being bred for hunting in water and having a water-resistant double coat.

Lottie Fact 3 - She is *extremely* good at tug-of-war.


_7/20 On Training_<br>
People sometimes ask, "So what tricks can she do?" and I find myself slightly annoyed, as if she were part of a circus show. Even our vet tried to shake her paw, and Lottie recoiled, confused at the vet's intentions. <br>
We began with virtual puppy training the week we brought her home. In the last six months, Lottie has learned how to listen to key commands, how to play with humans and other dogs respectfully, and how navigate her own emotions, all while quintupling in size and growing a whole new set of teeth. So, she may not be able to roll over (yet), and she may not shake your hand before a business meeting, but she has all the tools to be a wonderful companion and an important part of our family.
